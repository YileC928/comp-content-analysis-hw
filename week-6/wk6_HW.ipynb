So, we may randomly split the data and take a subset (perhaps 1/10 if the data size is large) and build a LDA topic model on it. Then extract commonly used words in each topic, incorporate them into the regression (e.g., the number of words in topic one the investors' connections use in their posts), and see if that would affect our results."

    "The paper aims to offer general methods for estimating the causal effect of changing on word on a certain sentence. One common and conventional way to identify such effect is through a Randomized Control Trial, which could easily disintangle treatment effect from the context, but is difficult to scale up for generalization. The authors propose two types of estimaters based on Individual Treatment Effect estimation - they formulate a ITE they call Lexical Substitution Effect (LSE) estimation specifically for the given context. The first method analyzes individual effect for labeled sentences, the second method approach the task as a classfication problem: to predict lebel $\\tau$, by $(\\omega_i, \\omega_j, s)$ (word before change, word after change and sentence). They apply the methos to three dataset - Airbnb listings, Yelp reviews, and Twitter messages. They also conduct RCT with the help of MTurkers to validate the robustness of their algorithmic estimates."
