Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.[1] One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.\n",

      "Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between academic disciplines. They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful pieces of content.[2][3] By systematically labeling the content of a set of texts, researchers can analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods, or use qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts.\n",

      "Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.[4]\n",

What is the social game, social work, or social actors about whom you are seeking to make inferences? What are the virtues of your proposed sample with respect to your research questions? What are its limitations? What are alternatives? What would be a reasonable path to \"scale up\" your sample for further analysis (i.e., high-profile publication)? (<150 words)?

    "I hope to explore the relationship between employee satisfaction and firm profitability. To extract the independent variable of interest (employee satisfaction), I would be analyzing text of employee reviews, possibly collected from Glassdoor. Firm profitability could be proxied by net income growth rate and stock return. Some specific questions about this social game that I am interested in are: Could employee reviews predict stock prices? Are firms with higher satisfaction level more resilient to economic crisis (e.g., 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19)? Does the effect of employee satisfaction vary across different industries? "

    "The social game here is companies’ performance in the economic world. Social actors are companies; to dig one layer further, social actors can also be employees. I choose Glassdoor review as my data source because 1. Glassdoor is one of the largest online company review platform which has a wide coverage of companies and large amount of text reviews. 2. The site was launched in 2008, so we can access data of a relatively long horizon. The limitation of using Glassdoor data is also obvious: because it is an online platform, we can only obtain reviews of employees who are online, are Glassdoor users, and post reviews. This can lead to issues in representativeness and affect external validity. Alternative samples are survey data and reviews on other platforms. To scale up, I may complement the sample with text from other platforms (e.g., large company review platforms in other countries)."
